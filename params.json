It is still incomplete, pull requests welcome.","body":"### tmdb-java\r\nA still incomplete Java wrapper around the TMDb v3 API, based upon JakeWharton/trakt-java/.\r\n\r\n**Pull requests (e.g. support for more API endpoints, bugfixes) against dev are welcome!**\r\n\r\nRemote services are grouped into local service objects which can be centrally managed by a ServiceManager instance. The manager will act as a factory for all of the services and will automatically initialize them with your API key.\r\n\r\nEach service contains methods which correspond to a remote method. Each of these methods instantiates a class that will allow for you to build the parameters using the Java builder pattern.\r\n\r\nRequired remote method parameters will be arguments to the service method and all of the methods in the returned builder are optional.\r\n\r\nWhen fully assembled, you can trigger the remote execution by calling the fire() method. This will return a native object which represents the result of the execution. All returned objects are immutable and should be handled as such.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
